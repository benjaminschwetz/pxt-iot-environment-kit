# Fork of ELECFREAKS Environment and Science IoT Kit

This project is a fork of the Environment and Science IoT, developed by [ELECFREAKS](https://www.elecfreaks.com/), [CLASSROOM](http://www.classroom.com.hk/) and [TINKERCADEMY](https://tinkercademy.com/).

Quote form [Tinkertanker/pxt-iot-environment-kit](https://github.com/Tinkertanker/pxt-iot-environment-kit): 

> The ELECFREAKS Environment and Science IoT Kit can detect all kinds of environment data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, light intensity, noise, dust, and PM2.5 level. In addition, you can upload these environment data to the [Thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com) IoT server (free registration required), using the [ESP8266 serial wifi module](http://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/esp8266-serial-wifi-module.html). 

# Why this fork?
I bought the IOT board because I think it is quite nice, but I don't want to use it with Thingspeak (booo matlab) and I want to use my own sensors. So here comes a more open extension package for makecode.
